                <h1>Barely nothing has got nothing on this!</h1>
                <p>Designing The Nothing App we really wanted to put emphasis on a minimal user interface. We wanted to go back to the roots of doing and being nothing. We used the newest technology, Swift programming language, to make sure we were pushing the boundaries of what we can do with nothing. We think you're really going to love this. - Jake Chapman (lead designer / engineer)</p>
